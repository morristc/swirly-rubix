    <p>
        Some of my favorite hobbies are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Welding
        </li>
        <li>
            Drawing
        </li>
        <li>
            Creating software projects
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        My favorite way to spend my free time, when I'm not doing something with my 
        family, is to weld.  I love taking scrap pieces of metal and creating 
        something new.  One of my favorite things to work with it, is actually
        used horseshoes sourced from local ferriers.

    <h2>What I'm Reading</h2>
    <h3>To Shake the Sleeping Self, by Jedidiah Jenkins</h3>
    <p>
        This book is the story of a man (Jedidiah), who rides a bicycle from Oregon to Patagonia, in search of who he is.
